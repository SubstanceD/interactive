      <p>Interactive is an experiment in projection mapping computer generated visuals and videos that respond to changes in music. The project is built in Processing.</p>

<a id="setup" class="anchor" href="#setup" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Setup</h2>

<p>This project has a few dependencies before we can get started.</p>

<p>First, install <a href="https://processing.org/download/?processing">Processing</a>. This has been tested with Processing 2.2.1. </p>

<p>Once you install Processing, you need to install our custom fork of <a href="https://github.com/ahollenbach/sketch-mapper">SketchMapper</a>, which is a system that allows us to map our content (Processing sketches, video, images) to surfaces. The instructions for installation can be found in that repository.</p>

<p>Once SketchMapper is installed, (the <code>target</code> directory has been copied to your Processing library folder), we need to install <a href="http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/code#library">Generative Gestaltung</a>, a library/series of beautiful visualizations that we're using (at least for testing). Download the <em>Generative Design Library</em>. You'll also need to grab a few of the dependencies. <em>ControlP5</em> is already provided by SketchMapper, so don't install that, but <em>Geomerative</em> and <em>treemap</em> may be necessary, depending on the visualizations used. To install these libraries, drag them to <code>&lt;Processing_Directory&gt;/libraries</code> (as you did for SketchMapper).</p>

<p>Lastly, clone this repository.</p>

<h2>
<a id="running" class="anchor" href="#running" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Running</h2>

<p>Simply open SketchMapperMain and press play! To go full-screen, go to <code>Menu &gt; Sketch &gt; Present</code>. To change the visualization, click on a quad surface and change the source file.</p>

<h2>
<a id="adding-visualizations" class="anchor" href="#adding-visualizations" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Adding visualizations</h2>

<p>Adding visualizations is simple. I recommend copying the format of the existing visualizations and starting from there. If you want a non-black background, be sure to establish it in <code>setup()</code>, as establishing it in the <code>draw()</code> routine will overwrite the visualization every time (unless this is something you want to do). You also need to add your sketch to the list of possible sketches in <a href="SketchMapperMain/SketchMapperMain.pde">SketchMapperMain.pde</a>. Make sure to give it a human-readable name that will appear in the dropdown.</p>
